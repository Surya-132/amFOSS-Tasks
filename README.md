 # amFOSS-Tasks

## Why must we choose you?

I’m relatively new to the field of programming and coding (although I did have some experience with Java during my 8th, 9th, and 10th classes, which I don’t remember much about). However, I am eager to work hard and participate in various programs. I believe amFOSS is an excellent place to learn, receive direct mentoring from our seniors and teachers, and make new friends.

## How would you contribute back to the club?

I aim to enhance the club’s reputation by excelling in various projects and competitions assigned to me. Additionally, in future semesters, I’d like to mentor other students—this would not only help them but also improve my communication skills.


## What are your fields of interest, and how do you plab on working on them?

Over the next six months, my plan is as follows: First, I want to focus on developing my skills in a specific language (probably Python or C++) and master it while working on a project. Afterward, I’ll strive for good marks in the end-semester exams. Finally, I intend to contribute to open-source projects.
