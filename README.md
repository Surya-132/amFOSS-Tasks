# amFOSS-Tasks

## Why must we choose you?

I'm fairly a newcomer in the field of programming and coding ('fairly' beacuse I had some programming using java in my 8th, 9th and 10th class which I absolutely do not remember about).I am willing to work hard and enjoy taking part in various programs. I think amFoss is a great place to learn and get directly mentored by our seniors and teachers and make new friends.


## How would you contribute back to the club?

By getting the good name to the club by excelling in various projects and competitions assigned to me. And in the future semesters I would like to mentor few students(so that I can improve my communication skills while helping my junior)


## What are your fields of interest, and how do you plab on working on them?

My plan in the next 6 months is that first I want to develope my skills in a particular language(mostly python or c++) and master it while working on a project. Then I will try to get good marks in the end-semester exams. Then I would like to work on some open source project.
