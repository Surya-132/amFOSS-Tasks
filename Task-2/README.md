# Part-1
This part went pretty smoothly. Using the tree command was the best decision, as I could easily locate the parchment without having to check all the entrances. From part 1, I found two codes.
# Part-2
This part was Overwhelming ,I had no idea from where to get the branch name from.After spending hours serching i decided to try decodeing the secret code from part-1 which gave me http:/github that's how i ended up checking github and finally found it.Everything after that went on nice used "grep" to loacte the herbs-Moonbloom and Mistveil.
# Part-3
As i learned about git branching it was fun to shift branches and exploring directories,Found 4 codes all together from Dark-Realms I and II.
# Part-4
This part left me Exhausting...The Base64 string URl which i got showed Server not Existing, After mismatching the codes i finally got URL:https://github.com/amansxcalibur/Terminal-Chaos-GodSuite.Rest all went with ease,found another code from the commit section of this repo on decoding gave me URL:https://github.com/angrezichatterbox/To-the-stars-and-realms-unseen. Really felt so satisfied after running the final python file.
