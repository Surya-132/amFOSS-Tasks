# Overview
This task went on smoothly, as I have been taking extra classes from a senior on the basics of CSS, JS and HTML. (The online ones were a bit confusing for beginners like me) (The senior is not from amFOSS)

I began with the terminal interface and linked it with FakeStoreAPI to fetch product data then managed command handling to fetch and display products within the terminal interface.

Then I went on to create a user interface using Html and CSS that also fetches data from FakeStoreAPI and displays products in grid layout. I have included all the commands given.
