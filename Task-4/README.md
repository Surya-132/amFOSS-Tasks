## View-point
This task was very challenging especially because of all the new functions and modules. I did most of the basic bot setup by watching tutorials.
I just think this is not a task that can be done under a time limit like this(I am not from a CS background). I guess there would still be bugs but this is the best i can do.
P.S. I did not customize much because of the time limit.
