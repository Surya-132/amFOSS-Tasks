I performed image processing to stitch together a series of images by connecting detected dots. It uses OpenCV and Pillow libraries to do this. The find_dot_center function reads each image, converts it to grayscale, and applies a binary threshold to isolate the dot. It then finds contours in the binary image, identifies the largest contour, and calculates its centroid. This centroid's coordinates and color are returned for later use. The sort_images function sorts the image files numerically based on their filenames to ensure they are processed in the correct sequence.

In the stitch_images function, images from a specified folder are sorted and processed one by one. For each image, the dot's center and color are determined using the find_dot_center function. If a dot is found, a line is drawn between the last processed dot and the current one, with the color of the line matching the color of the dot from the previous image. This process continues until all images are processed, and the resulting stitched image is saved as stitched_image.png. This approach effectively connects non-white blobs across consecutive images with lines, helping visualize connections or transitions between them.
